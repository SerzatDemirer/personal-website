                    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                    <p>
                        My name is Serzat Demirer I'm a Front End Engineer based in Helsingborg. I describe myself as a
                        passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform.

                        Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to
                        learn a
                        ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy
                        writing
                        technical things at my blog.

                        In my free time you can find me longboarding, at the gym, at the beach or on tech
                        meetups and conferences around Copenhagen and Europe.

                            <span class="work-description">As a Lead Front End Engineer, one of my main tasks was to
                                mentor coworkers of my team, contributing to their personal and professional growth. I
                                worked very close to
                                stakeholders to define, organise and breakdown new projects. One of the biggest
                                challenges I faced with
                                my team was to migrate the ulabox.com website to a new business model while refactoring
                                the
                                entire technology stack to Next.js and React. We had to integrate this pivot into the
                                Ulabox
                                application too. I've worked with the logistics team to build Android applications with
                                React-Native for our supply chain and dark stores.</span>

                                is available on iOS and Android. I worked on automating the process of shipping our
                                applications to the stores using Fastlane and Travis-CI. Also I contributed to the
                                maintenance of our website, that was built on top of Symfony using Twig, SCSS and
                                JavaScript.
